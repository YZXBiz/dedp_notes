    "# Pattern: Full Loader \n",
    "The Full loader implementation is one of the most straightforward patterns presented in this book. However, despite its simple two-steps construction, it has some pitfalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "Imagine there a dataset only changes a few times a week. It's also a very slowly evolving entity with the total number of rows not excedding 1 million. Unfortunately, `the data provide doesn't define any attribute that could help detect changed rows since the last ingestion.`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "`Because of the lack of last updated value in the dataset`, Full Loader pattern is an ideal solution to the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest implmentation relies on 2 steps, the extract and load (EL). It uses native data stores commands to export data from one database, and import it to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "This EL approach is ideal for homogenous data stores because it doesn't require any data transformation.\n",
    "```"
